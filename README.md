# Music-Player
This project deepened my understanding of frontend architecture by using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.

🧱 2. HTML
Defines the structure of the music player:

<audio> tag to load/play music

Buttons: Play, Pause, Next, Previous

Display area for:

Song title

Artist name

Album art


🎨 1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Responsible for styling the player:

Layout (flexbox/grid)

Button styles (play, pause, next)

Responsive design



⚙️ 3. JavaScript
Adds functionality (interactivity):

Play/pause music

Update song title/artist/cover

Move to next/previous track

Event listeners for button clicks
